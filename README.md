# Plankalkül
The first high level programming language ever created.


Plankalkül was created by the National Socialist German Workers' Party computer technology program in 1939-45. The chief architect was Konrad Zuse.

Up until that point, the National Socialists were relying on IBM's subsidary - Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH (Dehomag) for `tabulating` machines. There was concern that the American government would at some point stop IBM from actively supporting an enemy at a time of war, and so the government decided to fund local research into this field. This concern was later proven to be completely unfounded, but the German computer industry was born.
